            RFuW Engineering, Ltd. Facts, Business Philosophy & Value
            Proposition
          </h2>
          <h3 className="font__size-6">
            RFuW Engineering, Ltd. is a privately held, Singapore based company.
          </h3>
          <p className="font__size-2 about__text">
            Founded by industry veterans in 2014 to provide RF & Microwave
            products designed, developed, and manufactured within Asia targeting
            a global clientele of OEMs.
            <br /> <br />
            RFuW Engineering's founders have over 50 years RF & MW business
            experience and understand what the customer values: Performance,
            Quality, Price & Reliable Service. RFuW Engineering, Ltd. was
            founded as a privately owned entity, with zero debt, and registered
            in one of the most business friendly legal environments to combat
            this unhealthy industry trend. RFuW Engineering, Ltd. offers RF &
            Microwave OEMs a way out of this matrix and into an alternative
            reality.
            <br /> <br />
            Over the past decade OEMs in the RF & MW market place have become
            victimized by large scale, industrial consolidation fueled by
            numerous central banks easy money policies. Instead of employing
            these easy money policies to fund traditional research & development
            efforts, the vast majority of firms have instead launched into stock
            buy back programs or acquisitions, neither of which actually grows
            the overall market. While this process enriches the supplier's Board
            of Directors and senior management staff, it does little for the
            customer or the employees. While the acquiring firm will claim
            potential synergistic savings to justify their actions, recent
            history suggests that in most cases this industry consolidation
            process results in higher prices and tremendous increase in the
            level of uncertainty of future product support. Further, the
            associated sea changes in personnel and migration of manufacturing
            sites is a breeding ground for potential quality problems. In the
            end, customers and employees are the real victims.
            <br /> <br />
            RFuW Engineering, Ltd. was founded as a privately owned entity, with
            zero debt, and registered in one of the most business friendly legal
            environments to combat this unhealthy industry trend. RFuW
            Engineering, Ltd. offers RF & Microwave OEMs a way out of this
            matrix and into an alternative reality.
